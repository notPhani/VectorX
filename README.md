VectorX is  an All in one Research Platform that is researcher first. It has multiple coherent spaces to organise ur entire work like Scratch Space which is an infinte whiteboard to post your findings, qoutes from research papers (from research space), images, videos, files and more, Research Space a place where u do ur literature review this can be similar to many in use apps like Research Rabbit, Writing Space a text editor which supports multiple formats, autocomplete, tasks section, All connected via an AI agent who has access to a limited imformation that is the Research papers api, Ur spaces and common conversational training and nothing more so it's far from hallucination and mistakingly fixating ur thoughts on it's views. Here Ai is just ur assistant, or the organiser which organises ur files, and suggests grammatical changes and more. Say a case where, I am in my scratch space and I wanna add some qoute from some paper -> I can win+/ to pop up the command center to ask the AI to "hey, remember the paper where it talks about "Quantum Noise", can u add the quote that supports my current work?", and it does it for u and, Say I am writing something And I can ask the AI to "Hey, can u tell me what I am to write in this section we discussed about?", And calls ur tasks and more. And say when writing I can ask "Hey can u search some papers that derive this equation similar to my one?" say it doesn't find any, it gives u option to poke someone working in the same field or similar paper in the Community space. This is the basic overview I am thinking to build.
