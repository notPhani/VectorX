VectorX

VectorX is an all-in-one research workspace built for people who actually do research, not for managing them. The goal isn’t to automate thinking or replace judgment, but to remove friction between raw thought, evidence, and writing so you don’t have to keep context-switching or fighting tools while you’re working something out.

At its core, VectorX assumes research is messy. Ideas don’t arrive fully formed, structure isn’t obvious at the start, and writing usually happens much later than most tools pretend. Everything in the system is built around that assumption.

The starting point is Scratch Space. This is an infinite canvas where thinking happens without pressure. You can dump half-ideas, equations, diagrams, notes to yourself, copied quotes from papers, images, files—anything that helps you reason. There’s no forced hierarchy and no expectation that things are “final.” Scratch Space is deliberately permissive because that’s how real thinking works.

Alongside that is Research Space, which holds the actual evidence you’re working with. Papers you’re reading, their metadata, highlighted quotes, figures, and notes tied directly to sources live here. It’s similar in spirit to existing literature tools, but scoped to active research rather than endless discovery. Research Space acts as the ground truth for everything else—you’re always anchoring ideas to something concrete.

Writing Space is where things eventually crystallize. It’s a text editor that supports multiple formats and lets you break work into sections, attach tasks to those sections, and slowly turn messy thinking into something communicable. Writing isn’t treated as the center of the system; it’s treated as an output of the thinking and evidence you’ve already accumulated.

There’s also a Community Space, but it’s intentionally minimal. It exists for the case where your local notes and the literature don’t have what you need. If you’re stuck and no relevant paper turns up, you can reach out to someone working on a similar problem or related paper. There are no feeds, no engagement mechanics, and no attempt to turn this into a social platform.

All of these spaces are connected by an AI assistant, but the AI is tightly constrained by design. It only has access to your own spaces, a research papers API, and shared conversational context. It does not browse the open web, it does not form opinions, and it does not decide what matters. Its role is closer to an organizer or librarian than a co-author.

In practice, this means you explicitly invoke it when you want help. For example, while working in Scratch Space, you might bring up a command palette and ask it to insert a quote from a paper you vaguely remember discussing quantum noise. The AI retrieves that quote from your Research Space and adds it, with the source attached. While writing, you might ask it what you planned to cover in a section, and it will reference your existing notes and tasks rather than inventing content. If you ask it to search for papers deriving an equation similar to yours and nothing relevant is found, it tells you that and offers the option to reach out through the Community Space instead of hallucinating an answer.

A key constraint throughout VectorX is that AI never initiates actions on its own. It doesn’t suggest directions, impose structure, or try to “improve” your thinking. Everything it produces is editable, removable, and traceable to a source. If it can’t justify something based on your data or known papers, it doesn’t say it.

VectorX is meant to be a single environment you can live in from initial confusion to finished work, without losing control of your ideas or outsourcing judgment to a model. It’s not trying to scale to everyone, and it’s not pretending AI is the point. It’s built for people who sit somewhere in the middle—who don’t hate AI, but don’t want it driving either—and who care more about preserving agency than about shiny automation.

That’s it. No hype. Just a tool that tries to stay out of your way while you think.
